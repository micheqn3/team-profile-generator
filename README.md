## Team Profile Generator

employee in their team, which will be categorized into these classes: 
- Employee (parent class)
- Engineer (sub-class) 
- Intern (sub-class) 
- Manager (sub-class)

The prompts will continue to ask the user whether they want to add another engineer, intern, or finish building their team.
If they choose to exit, the applcation will retrieve the user data and render an HTML document that lists the profiles of
each team member, with their respective information.
