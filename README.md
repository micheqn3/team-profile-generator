## Team Profile Generator

This repository contains a team profile generator that is run through the command line using Node.js. 
The application uses the inquirer package to present a set of questions to the user about each
employee in their team, which will be categorized into these classes: Employee (parent class), Engineer, Intern, and Manager.

The prompts will continue to ask the user whether they want to add another engineer, intern, or finish building their team.
If they choose to finish building their team, the application will retrieve the user data and render an HTML document that lists the profiles of
each team member, with their respective information.
